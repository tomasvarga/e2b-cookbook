"""Agents API workbench backend.

Flask app that pairs each chat with a self-hosted OpenAI Agents API session
and an E2B sandbox: the sandbox is created from the public
`e2b/openai-agents-api-python-sdk-executor` template (E2B_AGENTS_TEMPLATE
overrides)
and runs `codex exec-server` inside it as the session's executor. Turns
stream to the React frontend over SSE; the workspace viewer reads /workspace
from the sandbox over the E2B API. Chats are resumable: idle sandboxes pause
instead of dying, and session/sandbox ids persist across backend restarts.

Threading model: Flask stays sync/threaded; one persistent asyncio loop
thread owns every async object (AgentAPISDK clients, AsyncSandbox, command
handles) so they never cross event loops. Flask handlers submit coroutines
with asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe via run_async(). Never call run_async
from the loop thread itself — that deadlocks.
